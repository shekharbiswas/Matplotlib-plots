# Guidelines

This piece of code will generate separate figure plot and legend plot. However, as the numbe of columns get increased, one has to asjust the figsize to correctly accomodate all the legend labels in the legend.png file.

The figsize here has been kept (30,15) which serves our purpose, however, one would have to increase it in case there are more than 150 features / legend labels.
